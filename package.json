  "info": "Solid Table is a collection of hooks for building powerful tables and datagrid experiences. These hooks are lightweight, composable, and ultra-extensible, but do not render any markup or styles for you. This effectively means that Solid Table is a 'headless' UI library.By acting as an ultra-smart table utility, Solid Table opens up the possibility for your tables to integrate into any existing theme, UI library or existing table markup.",
