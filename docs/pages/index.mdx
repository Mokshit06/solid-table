Solid Table is a collection of hooks for **building powerful tables and datagrid experiences**. These hooks are lightweight, composable, and ultra-extensible, but **do not render any markup or styles for you**. This effectively means that Solid Table is a "headless" UI library

<Callout emoji="✅">
  By acting as an ultra-smart table _utility_, Solid Table opens up the possibility for your tables to integrate into any existing theme, UI library or existing table markup.

## Overview

```jsx
function Table() {
  const instance = createTableInstance(table, {
    columns,
    data,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModelSync()
  })

  return (
    <table {...instance.getTableProps()}>
      <thead>
        <For each={instance.getHeaderGroups()}>
          {headerGroup => (
            <tr {...headerGroup.getHeaderGroupProps()}>
              <For each={headerGroup.headers}>
                {header => (
                  <th {...header.getHeaderProps()}>
                    {header.renderHeader()}
                  </th>
                )}
              </For>
            </tr>
          )}
        </For>
      </thead>
      <tbody {...instance.getTableBodyProps()}>
        <For each={instance.getPaginationRowModel().rows}>
          {(row) => (
            <tr {...row.getRowProps()}>
              <For each={row.getVisibleCells()}>
                {cell => (
                  <td {...cell.getCellProps()}>{cell.renderCell()}</td>
                )}
              </For>
            </tr>
          )}
        </For>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `createTable` function accepts a core `table` instance and an `options` object. `table` is an instance of `@tanstack/table-core`, that defines the structure of the table. `options` configures the data, columns and state of the table.

### Designed to have zero design.

You want your tables to be powerful without sacrificing how they look! After all, what good is that nice theme you designed if you can't use it?! Solid Table is **headless** by design (it's just a hook), which means that you are in complete and full control of how your table renders down to the very last component, class or style.

### Powerful and Declarative

Solid Table is a workhorse. It's built to materialize, filter, sort, group, aggregate, paginate and display massive data sets using a very small API surface. Just hitch your wagon (new or existing tables) to Solid Table and you'll be supercharged into productivity like never before.

And a lot [more](/docs/getting-started).
